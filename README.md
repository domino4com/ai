# Artificial Intelligence

While this repository is called AI, there are a distinct between the terms used in the AI world. So while this repository perhaps should have a more accurate name, I have chosen to call it AI, and let the reader check out this article from IBM: [AI vs. Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning vs. Neural Networks: Whatâ€™s the Difference?](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/ai-vs-machine-learning-vs-deep-learning-vs-neural-networks)

## Steps
This AI experiment covers a number of steps:
1. Get your hardware in order
2. Find training material to train your AI model
3. Build your AI engine
4. Modify your code to use the AI engine - don't worry, you get the code here, and you have to change 1 line of code!
5. Try it out

## Hardware
In this repository we are using the extended core [CVW](https://github.com/domino4com/CWV) with a camera, the OLED display [ODA](https://github.com/domino4com/ODA) and the power- and programmer unit [PPU](https://github.com/domino4com/PPU)

First check out this repository [CWV Camera](https://github.com/domino4com/CWV-Camera), which also has links and camera recommendations. Make sure you complete complete the camera example, so you know all your hardware is in order. Also if you haven't ever programmed the CWV, then visit this repositoiry first [CVW](https://github.com/domino4com/CWV).

You also need a OLED Library. For this exercise, 
* Install `U8g2 by oliver <olikraus@gmail.com>`. 
* Then open `Full Buffer` -> `Hello world`.
* Add these lines to where it says "UNCOMMENT"
```C
#define SDA 26
#define SCL 27
U8G2_SSD1306_128X64_NONAME_F_SW_I2C u8g2(U8G2_R0, /* clock=*/ SCL, /* data=*/ SDA, /* reset=*/ U8X8_PIN_NONE);   // All Boards without Reset of the Display
```
* Run the example and notice a `Hello World!` in the display.

## Training material
You can either start shooting images your self using your phone camera or you can download datasets with images for traing and testing. Making your own photos is much better, since you know the enviroment your model is going to operate in. Say you want to distinquis between onions, chili peppers and bananas, and the onions are always whole red onions. Then you don't need half onions, onion slices, deep fried onion rings, garlic, chives and other onion types. If the banana is always a single whole banana (called a finger), then you don't need a group of banana (called hand and stalk or bunch), nor banana peel, banana split, you get the idea. The better and more accurate the trainiung material the better accuracy.

For this example we are going to download a dataset (2Gb) from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com). Go here first and create a free account. Then download [this fruit/veg dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kritikseth/fruit-and-vegetable-image-recognition)

## Build your AI engine.
This is where the magic happens. We are going to use [Edge Impulse](https://edgeimpulse.com), so go here and create an account.
